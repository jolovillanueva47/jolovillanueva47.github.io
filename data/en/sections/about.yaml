# a summary about you
summary: 'A Swiss Army Knife. I started as a software engineer maintaining monolithic legacy apps then migrated it to Docker and Kubernetes shifted to SRE role supporting the infrastructure of other projects as well as the project I migrated. I love being a team-player and fill-in what is needed by the team. On my free time, I tinker around my linux configuration and read books'
